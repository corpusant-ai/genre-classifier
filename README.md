# ðŸŽ» Genre Classifier

Train a classifier that accepts the name of a musician and predicts the most likely genre of their music out of the set:

`{ jazz, opera, country, electronic, metal, rap, classical, reggae }`

You will train this classifier to operate on top of a pretrained text encoder that converts artist names into embedding vectors. 

## Steps

1. We've provided a data.json file, preprocess the data and compute an embedding vector from each artist name and save to disk. We suggest using the text encoder from [open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) and saving as a pandas dataframe.
```
python compute_embeddings.py data.json --output embeddings.pkl
```

2. Visualize the embeddings in a 2D projection space using [umap](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap). We provide the code for this.
```
python visualize_embeddings.py embeddings.pkl
```

3. Train a simple classifier to predict the genre from the embedding vector of the artist's name. It is up to you to pick an architecture, train, and evaluate the model.
```
python train_classifier.py embeddings.pkl
```
